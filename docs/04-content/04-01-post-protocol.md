# 04-01 Post Protocol

Every post follows these rules, whether it is created in the Blogger editor or sent by **Post via email** (which cannot set a custom permalink, labels or a search description).

## 1. Title: Thai first, English keywords in brackets

```textplain
{Thai title} ({3–5 English keywords})
ต้นไม้ในคอนโดแสงน้อย: 3 ต้นที่เลี้ยงรอด (Low Light Condo Plants)
```

- Blogger builds the permalink from the ASCII part of the title only, so the English keywords become the URL, e.g. `/2026/09/3-low-light-condo-plants.html`. Thai-only titles give meaningless URLs such as `/3-0001.html`.
- Keep the English part to 3–5 words; Blogger truncates long slugs.
- Do not put the post ID in the title. It shows up in Google results and the URL.
- Blogger adds a suffix itself if two posts end up with the same URL, so the ID is not needed for uniqueness.

## 2. Post ID: a hidden marker as the first line of the body

```html
<div class="mp-id" data-id="0002"></div>
```

- Four digits, unique, never reused. The next post takes the highest ID + 1. The register is below.
- The marker has no text, so it never appears in snippets, cards or feeds.
- `05-theme.js` still reads a legacy `#NNNN` at the end of a title, as a fallback.

## 3. Linking another post: type its ID

Write `#0001` anywhere in the body text. `05-theme.js` reads the blog feed and replaces it with a link whose text is that post's title. Unknown IDs and the post's own ID stay plain text; IDs inside code blocks or existing links are left alone. This works for email posts because the target URL does not need to be known when writing.

## 4. Body structure

1. Lead image with **no caption**: `<div class="separator"><img ...></div>`. Its credit goes at the very end of the post: `<p class="mp-credits">ภาพนำ: {photographer} / Pexels</p>`.
2. `<div class="mp-summary">` with a 1–2 sentence summary (about 150 characters). It must be the **first text** in the body: with email posting there is no Search description, so Blogger builds the meta description, the og:description and the home-page card snippet from this text (theme build .6 outputs `data:view.description` as `<meta name="description">`).
3. Intro paragraph, then `<div id="toc_container"><h2>สารบัญ</h2></div>`.
4. `<h2 title="{short TOC label}">` sections, optional `<h3>`, images with captions, `mp-note` / `mp-evidence` boxes.
5. Images come from Pexels, are stored in `02-meefunblog/11-images/` with credits in its README, and are linked from GitHub Pages.
6. Facts that could harm a reader (health, pets, money) cite a source; never invent numbers.
7. Evergreen by default: write so the post stays true and useful for years. Avoid dates, "this year", prices, promotions or news hooks in the title, URL or summary **unless the search intent explicitly requires a time-bound fact** (for example, current fees, tax year or platform rules). Put facts that will age in one clearly dated `mp-note` box so they are easy to update later.

## 4b. Lean editorial gate

Before publishing, answer these five questions:

1. **Intent:** Does the opening answer the reader's actual question/problem?
2. **Evidence:** Are material, changing or consequential facts sourced or explicitly marked for verification? For changing facts, include the source and checked date in the same `mp-note` where practical. Never invent numbers.
3. **Experience:** Is there a concrete human-use detail, example, caveat or workflow where the topic allows it? Do not fabricate first-hand experience.
4. **UX:** Can a reader scan the answer quickly with useful headings, bullets, tables or media where appropriate?
5. **Monetization:** Do Affiliate/AdSense elements support the answer without replacing it? For Affiliate links, use the applicable program terms and disclosure requirements, make the relationship clear to readers where required, and keep links contextually relevant.

## 4a. Posts that earn no AdSense revenue

A post that earns little or nothing is refreshed into evergreen content, not deleted. Keep its URL and post ID. Remove time-bound parts (news hooks, dates, prices), answer the lasting question behind the topic, and add links to related posts with `#NNNN`. Only change the text when it is actually improved; do not bump dates to fake freshness.

## 5. After publishing (Blogger editor, a few minutes)

Email posting cannot set labels or a Search description. The description is covered by rule 4.2; add labels afterwards in the editor if possible. Then ask for a CDP check of the post URL at 390px and 1366px.
